## Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' Theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory used for updating the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

### Formula

The formula is given by:

$$
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
$$

where \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability.



- **Applications**: Widely used in fields like medical diagnosis, spam filtering, and risk assessment.
- **Visualization**: Helps in understanding how prior probabilities are updated with new evidence to form a posterior probability.
